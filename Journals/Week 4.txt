--Monday-4th-Febuary--
----------------------
Previous Weeks Work
- Did not get the markov chain implemented, due to the Global Game Jam happening over the weekend
- Although the midi data is in a usable form now
----------------------

Todays task:
- Combine the Markov stuff with my origonal random music generator
- Start work on the rule system

Work Done:
- Combined Markov stuff with the origonal random music generator
-- Can now play forever, in theory
-- Also plays the notes in time with a preset bpm, ish
-- This will allow the code to control this with the rule system, when this is implemented

-----------------------
--Tuesday-5th-Febuary--
-----------------------
Todays task:
- Continue working on Markovs

Work Done:
- Added functionality to play chords, based on the current note and key, still sounds awful :ok_hand:
- Added function to specific chords based in the current chord

Reading Done:

Meeting with Grant (Assessed Progress Check)
- Went well (i think)
-- Grant is happy with my progress (and would be happy with it even if i had initially chosen this 
   project as my starting one, yass)

Work For Next Week
- Moer rulez
----------------------

Todays task:
- Fix code (accidently broke it when implementing the chord progressions)

Work Done
- Fixed it, now allows to toggle between chords and markov
- Markov now accepts chords
- Also fixed (ish) the chord progression bit, as i was telling it the wrong numbers

-----------------------
--Thursday-7th-Febuary-
-----------------------
Todays task:
- Chord Progression may not be playing exactly the right notes, check/fix this

Work Done:
