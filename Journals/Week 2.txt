Meeting with supervisor (Grant Clarke)
- It was short, I'd not done much over christmas

Work For Next Week
- I will hopefully get my markov chains working for midi songs
- If not getting the midi data read in into untity and in a usable format


-------------------------
--Thursday-24th-January--
-------------------------
Todays task; 
- Will be to read in a midi file and get the appropriate data, such as;
	- Pitch
	- Length
	- Where in the song the note start

Work Done
- Tried several librarys, got NAudio to work
- Managed to read in midi info and get the relevent info
- Unfortunatly NAudio doesnt let you directly access a notes length
- Had to do some janky string parsing to get note length, seems like a flaw in NAudio, banter

Today's Task
- To change the code so I can just tell unity the file name
  This will allow my application to work on different computers, 
  and I dont need to write out the entire path for the midi files

Work Done
- Got it working so you just need to supply the file name
- It now stores the each note's information in a struct, and holds them all in an array of lists
- It also now shows a basic midi visualiser
