Previous Weeks Work
- Did not get the markov chain implemented, due to the Global Game Jam happening over the weekend
- Although the midi data is in a usable form now

Meeting with Grant
- He was glad I actually showed him something this week

Work For Next Week
- Markoc chain working (PRIOTIRY)
- To have made a start on the rule based system
----------------------

Work Done
- Added function which adds rests, as a midi event, into the list of midi notes
-- So the Markov chain can analyse the music including rests

- Now calculates the frequency distribution of notes (including rests)

-------------------------
--Thursday-31st-January--
-------------------------
Todays task: 
- Redo the frequency distribution calcualtion
- Get simple markov chain working

Work Done
- Redid frequency distribution
-- The origonal way I had implemented it made creating a markov chain 
   from it impossible, as the data was not ordered in any useful way
- Implemented markov chain, it now produces music, terrible music, but music none the less
